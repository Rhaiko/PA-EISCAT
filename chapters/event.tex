\section{Space weather event}
In the rest of this document preprocessed data is used from the Halloween 2003 space weather event. This event took place from the 28th up to the 29th of October, with the main two peaks at 11:10 (28-10-2003) and 20:50 (29-10-2003) \cite{wiki_halloween_solar_stroms}.


This solar weather event consisted of a series of solar flares and coronal mass ejections. The series of storms were the largest ever recorded by the GOES satellite (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite). Satellite-based systems and communications were affected, aircraft were advised to avoid high altitudes near the polar regions, and a one-hour-long power outage occurred in Sweden as a result of the solar activity. Auroras were observed at latitudes as far south as Texas and the Mediterranean countries of Europe.
