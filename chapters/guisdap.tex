\section{GUISDAP software}
In this section the raw EISCAT data is processed using the MATLAB software with the package GUISDAP. This is done for the 27th of October 2016 from 18:00 to 19:00. This solar weather event consisted of a series of solar flares and coronal mass ejections. The series of storms were the largest ever recorded by the GOES satellite (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite). Satellite-based systems and communications were affected, aircraft were advised to avoid high altitudes near the polar regions, and a one-hour-long power outage occurred in Sweden as a result of the solar activity. Auroras were observed at latitudes as far south as Texas and the Mediterranean countries of Europe.
