\section{Conclusion}

In this report, the effects of the solar flares from Halloween 2003 on the ionosphere were analyzed and discussed. 
This report used data provided by EISCAT and Madrigad, to highlight and draw conclusions about the effects of solar flares on ionosphere.
The software used to analyze and create the graphs was GUISDAP by EISCAT in Matlab.
The effects of the flare were typical, and flare were clearly presented in the figures shown in the report. The electron density was almost a magnitude larger than the expected value from the IRI model.

%The effects of the storm were consequential but not severe in terms of health or technology impacts. This storm should serve as warning as the potential of a larger solar flare that could irreparably damage unprotected power grids or satellites. Damages to these systems could move human progress back decades.
